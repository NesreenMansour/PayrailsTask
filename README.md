# API Assessment Submission

## Overview

This repository contains my implementation for the assessment task.
I have developed the solution in **Python** using **Jupyter Notebook**, following the sample Python code provided in the assessment.

## Included Files

* **Postman Collection**: Contains the first two APIs for:

  1. Obtaining the access token
  2. Retrieving the public key

  * Additional API endpoints as outlined in the assessment can be added following the same structure.
* **Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)**: Implements the API calls and processes the responses according to the provided requirements.

## Development Notes

* I closely followed the steps mentioned in the assessment instructions.
* The implementation leverages the sample Python code provided, adapting it where necessary to ensure compatibility.
* While testing, I encountered a recurring error for which I could not identify the cause, despite carefully following each step. I have documented the error and my troubleshooting attempts within the notebook for review.

## How to Use

1. Import the Postman collection into your Postman workspace to review and test the endpoints.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook to view the Python implementation and run the API calls step-by-step.
3. Review the inline comments for explanations of logic and handling.

## Notes for Reviewers

* The error I encountered is reproducible and consistent across runs.
* I welcome feedback or suggestions on resolving it, as it may be related to API configuration or specific data handling steps.
